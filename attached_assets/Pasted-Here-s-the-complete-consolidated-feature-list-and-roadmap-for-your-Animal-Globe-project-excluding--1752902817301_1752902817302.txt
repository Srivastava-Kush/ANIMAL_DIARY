Here’s the complete, consolidated feature list and roadmap for your Animal Globe project, excluding the image-classifier AI/ML piece but including all your requirements and the earlier suggestions:

🏠 Landing Page
Title
– “🌍 Animal Globe” (or your chosen name) prominently at the top.

Navigation Bar
– Horizontal, three columns:
• Inspiration
• Author
• Blogs

Background Animation
- Bring in animation from react-bits.dev

Flashcard Slideshow
– A horizontally-scrolling carousel of animal flashcards.
- can also use a carousel from react-bits.dev
– Below the carousel provide a button to navigate to original slide.

🌐 3D Globe Website Core
IUCN Red List Categorization
– Ingest IUCN status via their API (or cached JSON). 
- As of now do it for a few animals . I THINK you will need to change animals.json a little bit.
– Draw a glowing ring around each animal’s marker:
• Critically Endangered → red pulse
• Endangered → orange glow
• Vulnerable → yellow glow
• etc.
– Include proper citation (“IUCN 2025…”) in footer.

Search & Filter Panel
– Search box: filter by animal name (partial match).
– Filter controls:
• IUCN category (dropdown or checkboxes)
• Biological trait (e.g., “egg-laying” vs. “live-birth”)

Double-Click Details Modal
– On double-clicking any globe marker, open a flashcard-style overlay with:
• Animal image & name
• Country/region info
• IUCN status badge & category
• Additional fun facts or stats

Geographic Clarity & De-Cluttering
– Display country/region labels more clearly (e.g., on hover or always-on at high altitudes).
– In high-density zones, cluster or “jitter” markers to avoid overlap; expand clusters on zoom.

All-Occurrences View
– When viewing a specific animal’s details, offer a “Show All Occurrences” button:
• Plot every known location from your dataset.
• Use larger/bright markers for high-occurrence areas, fainter for rare spots.To complete this task i think there will be a need to change animals.json and we will need to add one more field saying "Occurences" which will tell us where else do they occur.Or use any other better method if you have.

Report Discrepancies
– “Report Discrepancy” button in the details modal or main UI.
– Opens a form (email input or embedded Google Form) for users to flag incorrect data.

📣 Community & Content
Blogs Section (behind login):
- LET ADMINS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DELETE ANY BLOGS.
– Users can register/login (Spring Boot).
– Create, edit, delete their own blog posts.
– Upvote/Downvote buttons on each post.
– Authors see vote counts and view counters.
– (Future) Comments area and social sharing.
⚙️ Architecture & Tech Stack Suggestions
Frontend:
– Vanilla JS + Three.js/three-globe (no React/Vue needed)
– Modular JS (ES modules), CSS for styling, GSAP or CSS for animations

Landing Page:
– Static HTML/CSS/JS (host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Replit)

Backend:
– Spring Boot for:

Serving JSON & static assets

REST API for search/filter/blogs

Auth (Spring Security)

Scheduling (auto-refresh data)

Blog persistence (JPA + relational DB)
– ML microservice (Flask/FastAPI) if you later add image-classifier

Data Hosting:
– GitHub repo for animals.json, images, videos
– IUCN API token + cached JSON for statuses
